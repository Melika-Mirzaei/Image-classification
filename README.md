!Superpixel and Keypoint Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing images using superpixels and keypoints. The goal is to extract relevant features from images and create graphs based on these features.

Introduction
Image analysis plays a crucial role in computer vision, pattern recognition, and various applications such as object detection, image segmentation, and scene understanding. In this project, we explore two strategies for image analysis:

Superpixel Extraction:
Superpixels are compact, perceptually meaningful regions within an image.
We use the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm to obtain superpixels.
The number of superpixels is determined dynamically based on image content.
Superpixel coordinates and mean intensities are calculated.
Keypoint Extraction:
Keypoints (also known as interest points) are distinctive locations in an image.
We employ the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm to detect keypoints.
Keypoint coordinates and intensities (pixel values) are extracted.
Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/superpixel-keypoint-analysis.git

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main.py script to analyze an image.
Adjust parameters (e.g., threshold values) as needed.
Explore the extracted superpixels, keypoints, and their properties.
Features
Superpixel Extraction
SLIC Algorithm:
SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) is an efficient superpixel segmentation algorithm.
It groups pixels into compact regions based on color similarity and spatial proximity.
The resulting superpixels preserve object boundaries and reduce computational complexity.
Dynamic Superpixel Count:
Unlike fixed-grid approaches, SLIC adapts the number of superpixels based on image content.
Fewer superpixels are generated in homogeneous regions, while more are used near edges and textures.
Superpixel Properties:
We calculate the mean intensity (average pixel value) within each superpixel.
Superpixel coordinates (centroid) provide spatial information.
Keypoint Extraction
SIFT Algorithm:
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) detects robust keypoints.
It is invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes.
Keypoints are localized at distinctive image structures (corners, edges, etc.).
Keypoint Properties:
We extract both the coordinates and intensities (pixel values) of keypoints.
Keypoints serve as landmarks for further analysis.
Machine Learning and Classification
We go beyond feature extraction by applying machine learning techniques to predict image categories based on the extracted network properties. The following classifiers are evaluated:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Bagging
AdaBoost
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Voting Classifier (Ensemble)
Data Preparation
Load the attribute vectors from the CSV files (attribute_vectors1.csv, `attribute_vectors
