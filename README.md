# Superpixel and Keypoint Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing images using superpixels and keypoints. The goal is to extract relevant features from images and create graphs based on these features.

## Introduction

The code in this repository focuses on two strategies for image analysis:

1. **Superpixel Extraction**:
   - Superpixels are obtained using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm.
   - The number of superpixels is determined dynamically.
   - Superpixel coordinates and mean intensities are calculated.

2. **Keypoint Extraction**:
   - Keypoints are detected using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.
   - Keypoint coordinates and intensities are extracted.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/superpixel-keypoint-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to analyze an image.
2. Adjust parameters (e.g., threshold values) as needed.

## Features

- Superpixel extraction
- Keypoint detection
- Graph creation based on spatial proximity or intensity similarity

## Machine Learning and Classification

In this section, we'll explore how to apply machine learning techniques to the extracted network properties. We'll use various classifiers to predict the image categories based on these features.

### Data Preparation

1. Load the attribute vectors from the CSV files (`attribute_vectors1.csv`, `attribute_vectors2.csv`, `attribute_vectors3.csv`, and `attribute_vectors4.csv`).
2. Select the features (`Property_1`, `Property_2`, `Property_3`, `Property_4`, and `Property_5`) and the target variable (`category`).
3. Encode categorical data (if any) using an ordinal encoder.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Classification Algorithms

We'll evaluate the following classifiers:

1. **Decision Tree**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
4. **Bagging**
5. **AdaBoost**
6. **Naive Bayes**
7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
8. **Logistic Regression**
9. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
10. **Voting Classifier (Ensemble)**

### Results

Let's calculate the accuracy for each classifier:

```python
# Example usage for machine learning
def machine_learning():
    # ... (rest of the code)

machine_learning()
```
